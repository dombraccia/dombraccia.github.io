    "text": "The bioinformatics and computational biology discipline has seen dramatic growth in the last decade and is projected to continue growing.1 As the field continues to evolve, the software and computational tools do as well, so having a reliable and stable workflow is essential.\nEveryone has a prefered coding workflow, and no one setup is perfect. That being said, I have found that the combination of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for IDE, Quarto for creating notebooks, and Mamba for package management is a dynamic and powerful bioinformatics workflow in 2024!"

    "text": "2. Install Quarto\nQuarto is a document authoring tool that allows you to create rich text documents with code, output, and narrative text. It is a great tool for mixing code, explainations, and any interesting results you find. I mostly choose Quarto over Jupyter notebooks3 for the following reasons:\n\nLanguage agnostic: Quarto allows you to code in multiple languages in the same document. This is highly relevant in bioinformatics where you may need to switch between R and Python regularly for access to different packages.\nVersion control: Quarto documents are plain text files, making them easy to version control with Git.\nCustomizable output: You can output your document in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) with a single command.\nConversion to Jupyter notebooks: Quarto documents can easily be converted to Jupyter notebooks and vice versa, so you are never locked-in to one notebook system."

I prefer miniforge (mamba) over Anaconda or Miniconda because it is faster and more efficient. And if you’re already familiar with conda environments, just replace conda with mamba in your commands and you are good to go!\nTo install Miniforge, run the following commands in your VSCode terminal:\n# Run the following commands in your VSCode terminal. press: (ctrl + `)\ncurl -L -O \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\"\nbash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\nAlternatively, you can use wget to download the Miniforge installer:\nwget \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\"\nbash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\nWe will return to this part after step 4, cloning a git repository."
